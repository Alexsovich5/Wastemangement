# Development Plan - ERPNext Medical Waste Management System

## Immediate Next Steps

**1. Test the Fixes**
- Run `./load-env.sh development` to set up development environment
- Test `./start.sh` and `./setup-site.sh` with new configurations
- Verify health checks are working: `docker compose ps`
- Run automated tests: `node test-site.js`

**2. Deploy Environment Validation**
- Test staging environment: `./load-env.sh staging`
- Validate production environment setup (without deploying)
- Ensure all ports and configurations work as expected

## Medium-term Improvements

**3. Medical Waste Customization**
- Configure ERPNext modules specifically for medical waste management
- Set up item categories for different waste types (sharps, pathological, pharmaceutical)
- Create custom doctypes for waste tracking and compliance

**4. Monitoring & Observability**
- Add Prometheus/Grafana for metrics collection
- Implement log aggregation (ELK stack or similar)
- Set up automated backups for database and files

**5. Security Hardening**
- Implement SSL/TLS certificates via Let's Encrypt
- Add firewall rules and network security
- Set up user authentication and role-based access control

## Long-term Enhancements

**6. Business Logic Implementation**
- Waste pickup scheduling automation
- Compliance reporting dashboards
- Integration with waste disposal partners
- Mobile app for field operations

**7. DevOps Pipeline**
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Automated testing and deployment
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Ansible)
