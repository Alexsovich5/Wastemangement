# Medical Waste Management - ERPNext Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for setting up ERPNext as a complete medical waste management system. The configuration includes all necessary modules, custom doctypes, and compliance features required for healthcare facilities to manage medical waste from generation to disposal.

## Prerequisites

1. **ERPNext System Running**
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

2. **Site Created and Accessible**
   ```bash
   ./setup-site.sh
   ```

3. **Admin Access to ERPNext**
   - URL: http://localhost:8081
   - Username: Administrator
   - Password: admin123 (or your configured password)

## Quick Setup

### Automated Setup
Run the complete setup with a single command:
```bash
./run-setup.sh
```

This will configure all modules and create sample data for immediate use.

## Manual Setup (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Item Categories and Waste Types
```bash
docker compose cp setup-item-categories.py erpnext:/home/frappe/frappe-bench/
docker compose exec erpnext bench --site medwaste.local execute setup-item-categories.main
```

**What this creates:**
- Medical waste item groups (Infectious, Sharps, Pharmaceutical, etc.)
- Custom fields for waste classification
- Sample waste items (Red bags, Sharps containers, etc.)
- Specialized warehouses for different waste types

### Step 2: Stock Module Configuration
```bash
docker compose cp setup-stock-module.py erpnext:/home/frappe/frappe-bench/
docker compose exec erpnext bench --site medwaste.local execute setup-stock-module.main
```

**What this creates:**
- Medical waste UOMs (Gallon, Pound, Container, etc.)
- Stock entry types for waste operations
- Item attributes for waste classification
- Custom fields for stock tracking
- Pick list configurations for collection routes

### Step 3: Custom DocTypes for Compliance
```bash
docker compose cp create-custom-doctypes.py erpnext:/home/frappe/frappe-bench/
docker compose exec erpnext bench --site medwaste.local execute create-custom-doctypes.main
docker compose exec erpnext bench --site medwaste.local migrate
```

**What this creates:**
- **Medical Waste Manifest**: DOT compliance tracking
- **Waste Container Tracking**: Real-time container monitoring
- **Compliance Inspection**: Regulatory audit management  
- **Training Record**: Employee certification tracking
- **Incident Report**: Safety incident documentation

### Step 4: Manufacturing Workflows
```bash
docker compose cp setup-manufacturing-workflows.py erpnext:/home/frappe/frappe-bench/
docker compose exec erpnext bench --site medwaste.local execute setup-manufacturing-workflows.main
```

**What this creates:**
- Treatment workstations (Autoclave, Incineration, etc.)
- Standard operations for waste processing
- Routing templates for different waste types
- Bill of Materials for treatment processes
- Quality inspection templates

### Step 5: Buying Module for Vendors
```bash
docker compose cp setup-buying-module.py erpnext:/home/frappe/frappe-bench/
docker compose exec erpnext bench --site medwaste.local execute setup-buying-module.main
```

**What this creates:**
- Supplier groups for waste disposal companies
- Custom fields for vendor licensing and compliance
- Sample disposal vendors with contact information
- Purchase order templates for waste disposal
- Vendor evaluation criteria

### Step 6: Compliance Reporting
```bash
docker compose cp create-compliance-reports.py erpnext:/home/frappe/frappe-bench/
docker compose exec erpnext bench --site medwaste.local execute create-compliance-reports.main
```

**What this creates:**
- Custom reports for regulatory compliance
- Dashboard templates for waste management KPIs
- Print format templates for compliance documents
- Notification templates for alerts
- Workflow templates for approval processes
